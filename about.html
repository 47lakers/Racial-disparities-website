            <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting this my website.</h1>

            <p>My name is Ira Porchia and as a young black man, I created this
                website to shed light on the trials that black men and women
                have to go through on a daily basis. Not all black men and women
                are represented by these statistics on this website, but as you
                will see, a majority of them are represented by these statistics.
                My goal in creating this website is to help facilitate change by 
                causing people of all races and ethnicities to realize what their
                black brothers and sisters are dealing with.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here are some of the sources I used to show the disparities between blacks
                and the rest of Americans.
